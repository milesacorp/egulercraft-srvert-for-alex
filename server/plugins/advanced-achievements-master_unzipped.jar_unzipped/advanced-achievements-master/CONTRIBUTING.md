## Help and issues

Found a problem or need some help? The following steps may help:

1. Make sure you have gone through the [Wiki](https://github.com/PyvesB/advanced-achievements/wiki). A lot of questions have an answer in there!
2. Upgrade to the latest version of the plugin (available [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/advanced-achievements.83466/history)) and a recent Spigot/Bukkit build for your Minecraft version (see [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/#versions)).
3. Check your server's logs (including when plugins are loaded!), there may be warnings/errors/stack straces to help you out with your issue.
4. Do a quick search through the existing [issues](https://github.com/PyvesB/advanced-achievements/issues), you might get lucky!
5. Simply open a new issue and carefully fill out one of the three forms available if none of the above help or if you want to suggest a new feature! Help is free, so be polite and friendly! :heart:

## Pull requests

Want to make Advanced Achievements better, faster, stronger? Contributions are more than welcome, open a pull request and share your code! Here are a few pointers to help you out:

1. Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/PyvesB/advanced-achievements/issues) to get advice or discuss your change beforehand!
2. Go through the [Developers](https://github.com/PyvesB/advanced-achievements/wiki/Developers) guide to get the project up and running and learn how to interact with the plugin.

6. Run `mvn formatter:format` to make sure that your code style is consistent with the rest of the project. Your pull request should be ready for submission! :+1:
